# Array,Queue,Stack,Priority Queue(Heap)

## Basic data structure
### Heap

Heap is implemented as tree structure in logic view and array in physical view:

```shell
For node in index i:
Children: left: 2*i+1; right: 2*i+2
Parent: (i-1)/2
```

Time complexity for construct the heap is:

```shell
O(N): 1*log(1)+2*log(2)...+n*log(n) = O(N)
```
