/*
Given a singly linked list, return a random node's value from the linked list. Each node must have the same probability of being chosen.

Follow up:
What if the linked list is extremely large and its length is unknown to you? Could you solve this efficiently without using extra space?

/*
Reservoir sampling is a family of randomized algorithms for randomly choosing a sample of k items from a list S containing n items, where n is either a very large or unknown number. Typically n is large enough that the list doesn't fit into main memory.
â€¢	Keep the first item in memory.
â€¢	When i-th item comes
--With 1/i probability, replace the first item with new item
--With (1-1/i) probability, keep item
